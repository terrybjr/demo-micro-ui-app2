  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Understanding Micro-Frontends</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">A micro-frontend is an architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole. This approach extends the concepts of microservices to the frontend world, allowing teams to work on different parts of the frontend independently, and then integrate them seamlessly.</p>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Relation to Shell or Root Application</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">The shell or root application acts as the main container that hosts multiple micro-frontends. It is responsible for orchestrating the loading and rendering of these micro-frontends, ensuring they work together as a cohesive unit. The shell application typically handles common functionalities such as routing, authentication, and state management, while each micro-frontend focuses on its specific domain or feature.</p>
  <p>By adopting a micro-frontend architecture, organizations can achieve greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in their frontend development process. Teams can develop, test, and deploy their micro-frontends independently, reducing dependencies and speeding up the overall development cycle.</p>
